L2 weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of a model. It works by adding a penalty to the loss function during training, which discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely. This penalty is proportional to the sum of the squared values of the model parameters (weights).

### Mathematical Explanation

The regularized loss function with L2 weight decay can be written as:

$$ L_{\text{regularized}} = L_{\text{original}} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2 $$

where:
- \( L_{\text{original}} \) is the original loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression, cross-entropy for classification).
- \( \lambda \) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty.
- \( w_i \) are the weights of the model.
- \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2 \) is the sum of the squared values of the weights.

### How It Works

1. **Penalty on Large Weights**: By adding the sum of the squared weights to the loss function, L2 regularization penalizes large weights. This encourages the model to keep the weights small.
   
2. **Smoothness**: Smaller weights tend to produce smoother and less complex models that are less likely to overfit the training data.

3. **Generalization**: By preventing the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data, L2 regularization helps improve the model's performance on unseen data.
