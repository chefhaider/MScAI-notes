solution
- sampling classes differently, 
	- undersampling issue: not all data is used
	- oversampling: more often from underrepresented classes, issue: can lead to overfitting for underrepresented
	- for underfitting we can resolve by taking a different subset at each epoch
- data augmentation
- advance resampling strategied
