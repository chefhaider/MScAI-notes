- **Industry 4.0**: Interlinks production with information and communication technology, driven by increasing digitisation.
- **Robotics**: While the definition can get highly complicated, the lecture uses examples like **Linear Robot** and **Continuum Robotics** (Flexible Continuums-Robot, Hyperredundant Instrument) to illustrate the concept.
- **Industrial Robot** vs. **Medical Robot**: Contrasting characteristics such as lot sizes, workpiece categories, work areas, safety requirements, and workspace.
- **Medical Robotics**: Includes examples of clinical applications in diagnosis (e.g., brain tumour detection, COVID-19 detection) and treatment (e.g., task autonomy in surgical robotics, intelligent assistive systems).
- **Cognitive robots**: Enabled by the combination of Robotics and AI, requiring "enabling technologies" that connect data to algorithms. Several autonomy levels exist, but currently, there are no fully autonomous medical robots.
- **Classification of medical robots** uses dimensions such as inside/on/outside the body and physical system.
- **Tomography**: From ancient Greek, meaning 'section' (tome) and 'write' (graphein), referring to imaging techniques that produce sectional images.
