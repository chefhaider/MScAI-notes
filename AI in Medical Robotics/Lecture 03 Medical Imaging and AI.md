Here is a concise summary of the lecture on Medical Imaging to help you prepare for your exams, covering the topics and definitions from the source:

The lecture begins by defining **imaging methods** as diagnostic techniques using different physical principles to create images of the inside of the body. These methods generate images of real objects from physically measured variables, spatially resolved and visualised through brightness or colour codes. Medical imaging techniques are also used in various scientific and engineering fields.

Common **imaging techniques in medicine** include:

- X-ray
- Computed tomography (CT)
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, fMRI, NMR)
- Sonography (ultrasound (US))
- Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
- Optical surface scan
- Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which utilises radioactive tracers to visualise metabolic processes and can help in detecting cancer, neurological disorders, and heart disease.
- Single Positron Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)
- Thermography
- Digital subtraction radiography
- Scintigraphy, which images radioactive markers via a gamma camera.

**Tomography**, derived from Greek words meaning 'section' and 'write', involves creating sectional images (S) from projection images (P). Medical images can be layered/tomography (potentially 3D slices), volumetric (3D), or surface images (3D) which can also be films (4D).

A significant challenge in medical imaging is **image artefacts**, which are spurious results caused by properties of the method. Examples include partial volumes, aliasing (wrong measuring frequency), ring artefacts (detector issues), metal artefacts, patient movements, and foreign bodies.

**AI plays a crucial role in medical imaging** by:

- Recognising patterns, anomalies, and structures.
- Handling the high volume of data through prioritisation and pre-screening.
- Integrating data from different modalities for a holistic understanding.
- Enhancing image clarity, removing noise, and improving contrast.

**Radiology** is the medical specialty using medical imaging to diagnose and treat diseases. **Interventional radiology** involves minimally invasive procedures guided by imaging technologies. AI has significant applications in radiology, with a large number of FDA-approved AI-based medical devices and algorithms focused on this area.

**Radiomics** involves processing radiological imaging data to extract and analyse large quantities of advanced imaging features, transforming images into mineable data to provide additional insights into disease characteristics.

**Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD)** has been around for over 50 years and involves:

- Image preprocessing (noise reduction, filtering).
- Image segmentation (thresholding, structure differentiation, structure matching).
- Image/ROI analysis (grey level analysis, size, location, form). **Computer Aided detection (CADe)** detects and marks conspicuous structures, while **Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx)** evaluates these structures for classification.

The **AI in Radiology process** includes:

- Image acquisition (capturing raw data).
- Image reconstruction (transforming sensor data).
- Image post-processing (noise reduction, filtering, contrast improvement, feature extraction).
- Image analysis (detection, classification, model construction).
- Image interpretation (expert knowledge and experience).

AI in radiology uses **data-based image analysis** for tasks like image reconstruction/restoration and image classification/regression (e.g., bad/good quality, tumour visible/not visible). While AI can achieve high accuracy in tasks like object recognition, in medical imaging, it looks at radiological images by outlining tissues and potentially considering other factors like patient age and sex, which can increase accuracy but also introduce bias. The goal is **AI partnering with humans** through "intelligence augmentation", providing an intelligent tool for expert clinicians in treatment decision-making.

**Challenges when using AI in Radiology** include:

- Data quality and diversity (need for diverse datasets with few artefacts).
- Lack of availability of large, high-quality, annotated datasets.
- Data privacy and security (adherence to privacy standards).
- Generalization (AI must perform well on different datasets and systems, avoiding domain shift).
- Black-box approach (AI needs to be explainable and interpretable).

**AI in Medical Imaging** is used for various applications:

- **Image Classification**: Determining the type or category of disease. This involves training networks on labelled data to classify images (e.g., tumour or healthy tissue) based on features like shape, symmetry, intensity, and presence of edema. Validation is crucial to assess the accuracy of the trained network.
- **Image Segmentation**: Identifying and delineating specific structures or regions within an image. This can support surgeons with clear visualisation, guided surgery, reduced cognitive load, and quantitative analysis. **Semantic segmentation** differentiates between tissue, structures, and organs for robotic scene understanding. Deep learning models like U-nets, with their encoder (downsampling for context) and decoder (upsampling for localisation) architecture and skip connections, are used for biomedical image segmentation, including brain tumour segmentation. Neural Network Ensembles can combine different models for improved performance.
- **Feature Detection**: Locating specific features or anomalies within images.
- **Registration and Alignment**: Combining or comparing multiple images from the same or different modalities by transforming one image into the coordinate system of another. An example is intraoperative brainshift compensation, registering pre-operative MRI to intra-operative ultrasound using networks like iRegNet.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Predicting disease progression or patient outcomes from imaging data.

In summary, AI has significant potential in medical imaging across various modalities and applications, from image enhancement and analysis to aiding diagnosis and surgical procedures. However, challenges related to data, interpretability, and generalisation need to be addressed, and a collaborative partnership between AI and medical experts is essential.
