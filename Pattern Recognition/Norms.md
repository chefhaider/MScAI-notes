the function " ||.|| " is called norm which is used to provide distance between two vectors having properties:
- is non negative
- definite i.e if all values is 0 then the function output is zero
- is homogenous i.e ax = a.x
- fullfills the triangular inequality |x+y| <= |x|+|y|


- people prefer l1 norm because typically the solution is lying on the coordinate axis also why typically associated to sparse solutions which also results in non convex optimisation problems
- compressed sensing
