think about the problem of data: features, target, correlation, distibution, augmentation
start with simple and well known

 Hyperaramter search?
 learning rate decay, regularization, dropout, regularizaiton etc
 recommended to use log scale when experimenting   
 Random search is recommended over a grid search, optimize on coarse scale and then make it finer also, try training only for few epohcs, and then bring hyperparamters to a a sensible range
