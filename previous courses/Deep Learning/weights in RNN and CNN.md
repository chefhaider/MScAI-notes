In backpropagation for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the process involves computing gradients with respect to the weights in a way that leverages the structure and connections of these networks. The reasons for summing gradients (or weights) rather than computing them individually for each time step \( t \) in RNNs or each channel in CNNs are rooted in the following principles:

### 1. **Parameter Sharing and Efficiency**
- **RNNs**: In RNNs, the same set of weights (parameters) is applied at each time step. This parameter sharing allows the network to generalize across different time steps. When performing backpropagation through time (BPTT), the gradients are computed at each time step and then summed up. This summation provides a comprehensive gradient that reflects the influence of the weight over the entire sequence, ensuring efficient parameter updates.
  
- **CNNs**: Similarly, in CNNs, convolutional filters (weights) are shared across different spatial locations (e.g., across different parts of an image). During backpropagation, gradients are computed for each spatial location and then summed up to provide a single gradient for each filter. This approach leverages the spatial invariance property of convolutional layers, leading to more efficient training.

### 2. **Gradient Accumulation**
- **Temporal Accumulation in RNNs**: RNNs unfold over time, and the gradient with respect to a weight at a particular time step \( t \) can influence gradients at subsequent time steps due to the recurrent connections. Summing these gradients captures the cumulative effect of the weight over all time steps, allowing for a more accurate update.
  
- **Spatial Accumulation in CNNs**: In CNNs, the gradients are accumulated over all spatial locations where the filter is applied. This spatial summation ensures that the gradient update for the filter considers its effect across the entire input feature map, not just a single location. It also helps in maintaining the translation invariance property.

### 3. **Consistency and Stability**
- **RNNs**: Summing the gradients across all time steps helps in mitigating issues like vanishing or exploding gradients by distributing the gradient contributions over the entire sequence. This can lead to more stable and consistent updates.
  
- **CNNs**: Summing the gradients across spatial dimensions ensures that the updates to the filters are consistent with the overall objective of minimizing the loss across the entire input image, leading to more stable convergence during training.

### 4. **Reduction of Complexity**
- **RNNs**: By summing the gradients rather than maintaining separate gradients for each time step, the complexity of the parameter update step is reduced. This makes the backpropagation algorithm computationally efficient and easier to implement.
  
- **CNNs**: In CNNs, summing the gradients simplifies the process of updating the filters, reducing computational overhead and memory usage compared to maintaining separate gradients for each spatial location.
