A saliency map highlights the most important parts of an image that a model (such as a neural network) uses to make a decision. Here's a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Image**: An image is fed into the model.
2. **Forward Pass**: The model processes the image and makes a prediction.
3. **Gradient Calculation**: To understand which parts of the image influenced the prediction the most, the gradient (or sensitivity) of the output with respect to each pixel of the input image is calculated.
4. **Highlighting Important Areas**: These gradients are then visualized as a heatmap, where higher values indicate areas of the image that had a stronger influence on the model's prediction.

The resulting heatmap, or saliency map, shows which parts of the image are most "salient" or important for the model's decision.
