Google DeepDream, also known as Inceptionism, is a computer vision program that enhances patterns in images to create dream-like, surreal visuals. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. **Input Image**: You start with an ordinary image.
2. **Neural Network**: The image is fed into a pre-trained neural network, typically one used for image recognition.
3. **Feature Amplification**: The program identifies patterns and features (like edges or shapes) that the network recognizes in the image.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Instead of stopping at recognizing these features, DeepDream enhances them by feeding the modified image back into the network and repeating the process.
5. **Exaggeration**: Each iteration amplifies the recognized features more, resulting in exaggerated and often bizarre patterns.

The final result is a highly detailed, dream-like image where features like eyes, faces, or animals might appear in unexpected places, giving the image a surreal quality.
