Guided backpropagation is a technique used to visualize and understand the features learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN). It enhances the standard backpropagation method to produce clearer and more interpretable visualizations of the input features that are important for a network's predictions.



1. **Backpropagation**:
   - Standard backpropagation is the process of computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input image by propagating the gradients backward through the network. This gradient indicates how much each pixel in the input image affects the final output.

3. **Guided Backpropagation Mechanism**:
   - In guided backpropagation, the standard backpropagation process is modified to enforce additional constraints at ReLU layers. Specifically, the gradients are allowed to flow backward through a ReLU only if both the forward pass activation and the backward pass gradient are positive. This modification helps to filter out irrelevant or noisy gradients, leading to cleaner visualizations.



2. **Backward Pass (Guided Backpropagation)**:
   - When computing the gradients during the backward pass, guided backpropagation modifies the gradient calculation at each ReLU layer. It applies the following rule:
     - If the gradient flowing backward is positive and the forward activation is positive, the gradient is passed through.
     - Otherwise, the gradient is set to zero.


### Conclusion

Guided backpropagation is a powerful tool for visualizing and interpreting the features learned by convolutional neural networks. By modifying the standard backpropagation process, it produces clearer and more focused visualizations, helping researchers and practitioners understand the inner workings of their models.
