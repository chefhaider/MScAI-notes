stereo: two cameras 
a stereo vision must solve two problems
- correspondence problem (disparity)
- reconstitution problem

multiple cameras can be considered for precision


identify a position of certain point in 3D.
 - we need intrinsic and eccentric camera paramters
 - we have the centre of the camera, we know where the image plane is and then we draw the line  in to the 3d world, and where ever those lines meet  is the poisiton of our point
 - locating where the camera is located
 - finding points in multiple images
	 - follow along the epiplor line to find the point
	 - our assumption is that epipolar lines are parellel
- binocular stereo:   identifying depth of objects based on movements
	
	

- noise and correspances - estimation of the points would be slightly off
