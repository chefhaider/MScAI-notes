- distance to the hyperplane is alpha, the feature vector gets classified based on the initalised parameters alpha and alpha_not, we minimise the D(a,a_not) for missclassified featured
- convergence theorem - the covergence algorithim depends upon the maximum distance from the coordinate origin, the offset of the decision boundary and the width of the area around the decision boundary
- the objective function changes in each iteration step

properties
- non linear optimisation
- linearly seperate
- discrete problem
- final boundary depends on initilisation
- iterations does not depends upon dimenisons of x
