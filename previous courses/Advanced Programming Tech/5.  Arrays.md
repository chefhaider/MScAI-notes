- **Array**: An array is a **data structure that holds a collection of unnamed objects that can be accessed by an index**.
    
    - Example: `int arr;`
- **dynamically allocated**: An object that is **allocated on the program's free store**. Objects allocated on the free store exist until they are explicitly deleted.
    
- **free store (heap)**: A **memory pool available to a program to hold dynamically allocated objects**. A security problem associated with the heap is **buffer overflow**.
    
- **[] operator**: The subscript operator **takes two operands: a pointer to an element of an array and an index**.
    
    - Its **result is the element that is offset from the pointer by the index**.
    - **Indices count from 0**.
    - The subscript operator **returns an lvalue**.
- **++ operator**: When used with a pointer, the increment operator **"adds one" by moving the pointer to refer to the next element in an array**.
    
    - Example: `++i;` (Note: while the example shows `++i`, the context explains its use with a pointer, e.g., if `int* p` points to an element in an array, `++p` would move `p` to the next element).
- **New and delete expressions**: Managing dynamic memory is **error-prone**. Potential issues include:
    
    - **Memory leak** when memory is not freed.
    - **Reading or writing to the object after it has been deleted**.
    - **Applying delete to the same memory location twice**.
- **New and delete**:
    - **new expression**: Allocates dynamic memory.
        - To allocate an array of `n` elements: `new type[n];`
        - `new` **returns a pointer to the first element in the array**.
    - **delete expression**: Frees memory that was allocated by `new`.
        - For a single object: `delete p;` (Note: this is implied, but not explicitly stated for a single object in this section).
        - For an array: `delete [] p;`
        - `p` **must be a pointer to the first element in a dynamically allocated array**.
        - The **bracket pair `[]` is essential** as it indicates to the compiler that the pointer points at an array, not at a single object.
- **operator delete**: A **library function that frees untyped, unconstructed memory**.
    
- **copy control**: Special members that **control what happens when objects of class type are copied, assigned, and destroyed**. The **Rule of Three/Five** states that if a class needs a nontrivial destructor then it almost surely also needs to define its own copy constructor, an assignment operator, and in C++11, a move constructor and move-assignment operator. The **“resource acquisition is initialization” (RAII) idiom**:
    
    - In C++, RAII can be realised by **smart pointers**, e.g., the `shared_ptr`.
    - Example of RAII:
        
        ```
        class someResource {
        //internal representation holding pointers, handles etc.
        public:
            someResource(){
                //Obtain resource.
            }
            ~someResource(){ //Release resource. }
        };
        ```
        
- **Standard Library allocator class**: A **library class that allocates unconstructed memory**. If one uses `new`, memory is allocated and objects are constructed in that memory. When allocating a block of memory, one often plans to construct objects in that memory when needed. The allocator class **allows one to decouple construction from allocation**.
    
- **Managing Pointer Members**: For smart pointers like `shared_ptr`, each `shared_ptr` object maintains a **use count** of how many `shared_ptr`s point to the same object. When a `shared_ptr` is copied or assigned, the use count is incremented. When a `shared_ptr` goes out of scope or is reset, the use count is decremented. The **assignment operator and the destructor check whether the decremented use count has gone to zero and, if so, they destroy the object**.
    
- **Standard Library smart pointers**:
    
    - **shared_ptr**: Allows **multiple pointers to refer to the same object**.
        - Example: `shared_ptr<int> pi(new int(1024));`
    - **unique_ptr**: **Owns the object to which it points**. (Implies exclusive ownership; cannot be copied).
    - **weak_ptr**: **Does not control the lifetime of the object to which it points**. (Used to observe a `shared_ptr` without preventing the object from being deleted).
