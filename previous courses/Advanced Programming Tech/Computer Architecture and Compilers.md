Lecture 2 covers computer architecture and compilers and can be summarised as follows:

- **History of Computing:**
    - The first working electronic computer was created in 1946 by Eckert and Mauchly.
    - FORTRAN I, the first high-level language, was developed by John Backus and IBM between 1954 and 1957.
- **Von Neumann Architecture:**
    - The concept was first described in 1945 by John von Neumann.
    - Data and code are binary coded in the same memory.
    - The computer fetches, decodes, executes commands sequentially, and saves the result.
    - Parameters include data width, addressing width, the number of registers, and the instruction set.
- **Classification of Computer Architecture:**
    - **CISC** (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
    - **RISC** (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
- **Compiler Basics:**
    - Compilers translate programming languages into machine-understandable code.
- **Compiler Construction:**
    - Programming languages are notations for describing computations to people and machines.
    - A compiler is required to translate the code.
- **Static/Dynamic Distinction:**
    - C++ is statically typed.
    - Python is dynamically typed.
- **Environments and States:**
    - Environment: mapping names to locations
    - States: mapping from locations to values
- **Scope:** Hierarchical in C++.
- **Compiler Phases:**
    - **Parsing:** Syntax tree creation
    - **Semantic Analysis:** Uses syntax tree and symbol tables to gather type information and check for semantic consistency errors.
    - **Intermediate Code Generation:** Generates code for an abstract machine.
        - Easy to produce and translate to the target language.
        - Uses three-address code.
        - Requires temporary names for holding values.
    - **Intermediate Code Optimization**
- **Clang AST:** Clang provides a language front-end and tooling infrastructure for the C language family.
