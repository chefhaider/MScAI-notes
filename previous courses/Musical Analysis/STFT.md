x -  is signal
w - is window which is pointwise multiplied
L - length of signal
N - length of window
H - hop size jump of window
m - time index of the singal
k - frequency bin index 

T_coeffs: the phsysical time association with each frame
F_coeefs: the physical frequency association with each bin k

why do we take absolute magnitude of X/stft??
