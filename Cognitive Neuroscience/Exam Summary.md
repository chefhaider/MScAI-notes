				the action potential can be reconstructed from the properties of sodium and potassium channels
				Na+ and K+ ions vary as a graded function of the membrane potential
				as the voltage become more potiive, Na+ ions decline and zero at membrane potential. 55 mV = equilibrium potential
				the size of Na and K currents is determined by two factors: Magnitude of the concdutance and Eltrochemical driving force
				Observed Current I = Kirchhoffs law + conductances x variables + leak current (error)

### 5. Neural Plasticity

	brain emegance:
		cell division > morula (ball of cell) > blastula > gastrula three layers of cells endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm > ectorderm becomes the neural plate > peripheral nervous system arrives > seperates and forms the neural tube > develops in sequential stages > anteroposterior patterning signals establish distinct transcription factor
		Hox genes- motor neurons
	Differentiation and survivial of nerve cells
			after birth: wiring phase (new synapases are build)
			in adolesence: rewiring phase (net number of synapases remain)
			in dnn. pruning snapses and nuuraon, making sparese and dense
			age 14 to adult pruning occurs
	Synaptic plastic rules

### 11. Visual System

different visual fields:
- hemifield
- x eye visual field
- binocular visual field
- full visual field

retina (photoreceptor - > bipolar cell -> genglion cell )-> thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus) -> cerebral cortex (primary visual cortex)
neural communication is against the communication of light
why inverted in vertebrates?
- light guides by ganglion cells, maintenance of photo receptors, existing retinal pigment - avoiding back reflections

bipolar cells - bypass/invert signal 
ganglion cells - encode signals using action potentials
Bayer Pattern - RGB array, camera interpolates the missing grid to complete the image - the optic disk, where the nerve leaves the eyes has no photoreceptors, the brain fills in this gap and can sometimes be tricked

The receptive field
- ==group== of ==photoreceptors== as well as ==horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells== that sends ==signal== to a single retinal ==ganglion cell.==
- retina dosent have uniform resolution across its surface
- contrast enhancement is realised based off interconnectednes
- lateral inhibition: large membrane potential difference, enhance the perception between dark and light edges.
The Visual Cortex:
- ocular dominance colums
- orientation columns - neurons active if the their orientation is represented in the visual field
	  
Object recognition
- dorsal stream (where), central stream (what)
- object representation: emotional valence, signals from other snesory modalities, image linking, associative linking, categorical linking

Face Recognition
- responsible: Inferior temporal cortex
- Hypthosis
	- Ensemble Coding Hypothesis: different features are seperated and ensemble leads to identification
	- single neuron spike
- dimensional reduction high level, low dimensional representation
	- PCA, NMF


### 12. Motor System

brain evolved to control muscles and interact with the environment
elicit behaviour
skeletal muscles (can only be controlled) caridac and  smooth
can only contract in one direction

Motor Neurons: control muscle fibers (neurons connected based on the amount needed), maintaing consistent tension regardless of which motor is used
Sensory Neurons: trigger reflexes, while the brain is involved through pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts (carry motor signals from brain to the spinal cords)

- Internal models
	- Inverse models: for the desired trajectory generates motor command
	- forward models: for the input, predicts the movement and reduces error
### 13. Language, Attention, and Saliency

charachteristics:
	- communicative - comprehension of informaiton
	- arbitrary - symbols attached to arbitiary things
	- structured - symbols ordered by rules
	- generative - infiite number of ordering, makes the idea so powerful
	- dynamic  - language changes overtime

- phoneme, morphemes, syntax, pragmatics

- Anatomy of languages: 
	- left temporal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, left hemisphere, right hemisphere
- lesion studies and apasia (deficty in language understanding and production)
- language comprehension
	- perceptual analysis, access to representations 
- language comprehension
	- done in three steps:
	- perceptual analysis
		- translated into phonological/orthographic input code - challenge is for it to be divided into relevant speech signals
	- representation in mental lexicons
	- lexical integration



### 14. Memory,  and GPT3/4
### **Memory: Key Points**

#### **Definition & Importance**

- **Memory**: Brain's ability to **encode, store, and retrieve** information.
- **Essential** for language, relationships, and personal identity.
- **Learning** = Acquiring new information → **Outcome** is memory.

#### **Types of Memory**

- **Sensory Memory** (Unconscious, very short-term)
- **Short-term Memory** (Conscious, limited capacity)
- **Working Memory** (Active processing & manipulation)
- **Long-term Memory**:
    - **Declarative (Explicit)**: Conscious (Semantic, Episodic)
    - **Non-declarative (Implicit)**: Unconscious (Procedural, Perceptual, Conditioning, Non-associative)

#### **Memory Processing Stages**

1. **Encoding**: Processing incoming information
    - **Acquisition**: Sensory → Short-term memory
    - **Consolidation**: Stabilization for long-term storage
2. **Storage**: Permanent record of information
3. **Retrieval**: Accessing stored data

#### **Anatomy of Memory**

- Memory formation = **Synaptic changes**.
- **Medial temporal lobe (Hippocampus & surroundings)** → Key role.

#### **Amnesia (Memory Loss)**

- **Brain damage → Amnesia**
- **Anterograde**: Cannot form new memories.
- **Retrograde**: Loss of past memories (may be partial).

#### **Short-Term Memory Forms**

1. **Sensory Memory** (Unconscious, high capacity, brief duration)
    - **Auditory** (Echoic, ~10 sec)
    - **Visual** (Iconic, ~400 ms)
    - **Touch** (Haptic)
2. **Short-term Memory** (Conscious, ~5–9 items, debated)
    - **Atkinson-Shiffrin Model**: Items move from sensory to short-term, then to long-term with rehearsal.
3. **Working Memory** (Active use of short-term info)
    - **Maintenance** (Holding info temporarily)
    - **Manipulation** (Processing info, e.g., mental math)
    - **Baddeley & Hitch Model**:

        - **Episodic Buffer** (Integration with long-term memory)

#### **Long-Term Memory Forms**

- **Stored for days/months/years**
- **Two main branches**:
    1. **Declarative Memory (Explicit, Conscious)**
        - **Medial Temporal Lobe** crucial for **encoding & consolidation**.
        - **Hippocampus** plays a key role in:
            - **Encoding**: Forming long-term memories.
            - **Retrieval**: Reactivating episodic memories.
            - **Consolidation**: Gradual shift of memories to **neocortex** (Ribot’s Law: Older memories less hippocampus-dependent).
        - **Sleep** may enhance consolidation.
    2. **Non-Declarative Memory (Implicit, Unconscious)**
        - Includes **skills, habits, and conditioning**.
