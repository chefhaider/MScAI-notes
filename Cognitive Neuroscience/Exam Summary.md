### 4. Neurons and Gila
	neuron, dendraits, Axon, Precenaptic Cell, Action Potential
	Types of Neurons
			bipolar cell of retina: one base dendraite with muliple cells on top
			Ganglion cell of dorsal root: for sensory informaiion. Not the connection between dendrites and the axons
			motor neurons: specialised for efferent motor signals. the dendrites are rooting from the cell
			purkinje cell of cerebellum: motor learning and nervous system: has alot of dendrites flowing out
		Synapsis - presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic dendrite. synapsis gap 20nm
		Theoratical Neuron, Binady, Perceptrons, Xor affair and Multi layer Perceptrons
		The Axon and the diverese ways of conduction.
			instulation with myelin sheets, node of ranvier, salatory conduction
			grouping for the peripheral nerve fibers based on diameter, signal conduction and myelinneation state.
			A group highconduction B groupt low conduction, C group lack in myelin and casues slow conduciton. A delta and C fibers both detection of diverese painful stimuli. A delta is for sharp acute paints, C is for long lasting pains
		Micorolia - 10-15% of the calls maintaing the brain activity, and removing bad cells, in parkinsons these are unable to do do therefore...
			they are immune cells
		Astrocytes
			forming phyical structure of the brain, scretion or absorption of neural transmitters, and mainting the blood brain barrier. also controling the amount of neutrient for the neurons.
			The tripartite synapse - astrocytes regulate the glutamate biosynthesis 
		Neural Computation and Aciton Potential
			Resing potential of a neuron membrane: -60 to -90 mV
			based on net ion flow, rest state change, can either depolariye or hyperpolarize - mebrane is like a capacitor
			the ion concentration are highly different between concrentration and cytoplasm and extra cellular fluids

				the action potential can be reconstructed from the properties of sodium and potassium channels
				Na+ and K+ ions vary as a graded function of the membrane potential
				as the voltage become more potiive, Na+ ions decline and zero at membrane potential. 55 mV = equilibrium potential
				the size of Na and K currents is determined by two factors: Magnitude of the concdutance and Eltrochemical driving force
				Observed Current I = Kirchhoffs law + conductances x variables + leak current (error)

### 5. Neural Plasticity

	brain emegance:
		cell division > morula (ball of cell) > blastula > gastrula three layers of cells endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm > ectorderm becomes the neural plate > peripheral nervous system arrives > seperates and forms the neural tube > develops in sequential stages > anteroposterior patterning signals establish distinct transcription factor
		Hox genes- motor neurons
	Differentiation and survivial of nerve cells
			after birth: wiring phase (new synapases are build)
			in adolesence: rewiring phase (net number of synapases remain)
			in dnn. pruning snapses and nuuraon, making sparese and dense
			age 14 to adult pruning occurs
	Synaptic plastic rules
		forms of plasticity:
			Structural plasticity
			Synaptic Plasticity
			activation - v=u*w, hebbs rule "change the weight in a time dependent context as one wants to learn across time" aka correlation based plasiticity rule

### 11. Visual System

different visual fields:
- hemifield
- x eye visual field
- binocular visual field
- full visual field

retina (photoreceptor - > bipolar cell -> genglion cell )-> thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus) -> cerebral cortex (primary visual cortex)
neural communication is against the communication of light
why inverted in vertebrates?
- light guides by ganglion cells, maintenance of photo receptors, existing retinal pigment - avoiding back reflections

bipolar cells - bypass/invert signal 
ganglion cells - encode signals using action potentials
Bayer Pattern - RGB array, camera interpolates the missing grid to complete the image - the optic disk, where the nerve leaves the eyes has no photoreceptors, the brain fills in this gap and can sometimes be tricked

The receptive field
- ==group== of ==photoreceptors== as well as ==horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells== that sends ==signal== to a single retinal ==ganglion cell.==
- retina dosent have uniform resolution across its surface
- contrast enhancement is realised based off interconnectednes
- lateral inhibition: large membrane potential difference, enhance the perception between dark and light edges.
The Visual Cortex:
- ocular dominance colums
- orientation columns - neurons active if the their orientation is represented in the visual field
	  
Object recognition
- dorsal stream (where), central stream (what)
- object representation: emotional valence, signals from other snesory modalities, image linking, associative linking, categorical linking

Face Recognition
- responsible: Inferior temporal cortex
- Hypthosis
	- Ensemble Coding Hypothesis: different features are seperated and ensemble leads to identification
	- single neuron spike
- dimensional reduction high level, low dimensional representation
	- PCA, NMF


### 12. Motor System

brain evolved to control muscles and interact with the environment
elicit behaviour
skeletal muscles (can only be controlled) caridac and  smooth
can only contract in one direction

Motor Neurons: control muscle fibers (neurons connected based on the amount needed), maintaing consistent tension regardless of which motor is used
Sensory Neurons: trigger reflexes, while the brain is involved through pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts (carry motor signals from brain to the spinal cords)

- Internal models
	- Inverse models: for the desired trajectory generates motor command
	- forward models: for the input, predicts the movement and reduces error
### 13. Language, Attention, and Saliency

charachteristics:
	- communicative - comprehension of informaiton
	- arbitrary - symbols attached to arbitiary things
	- structured - symbols ordered by rules
	- generative - infiite number of ordering, makes the idea so powerful
	- dynamic  - language changes overtime

- phoneme, morphemes, syntax, pragmatics

- Anatomy of languages: 
	- left temporal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, left hemisphere, right hemisphere
- lesion studies and apasia (deficty in language understanding and production)
- language comprehension
	- perceptual analysis, access to representations 
- language comprehension
	- done in three steps:
	- perceptual analysis
		- translated into phonological/orthographic input code - challenge is for it to be divided into relevant speech signals
	- representation in mental lexicons
	- lexical integration
