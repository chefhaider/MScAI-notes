#### **1. Resting Membrane Potential**

- Every neuron has a resting potential between **-60 to -90 mV**.
- This is calculated as: **Vm = Vin - Vout**.
- The membrane acts like a **resistor and a capacitor**.
- Changes in ion flow cause depolarization (more positive) or hyperpolarization (more negative).

#### **2. Ion Concentration Differences**

- The inside (cytoplasm) and outside (extracellular space) have different ion concentrations:
    - **K+ (Potassium)** is higher inside the cell.
    - **Na+ (Sodium) & Cl- (Chloride)** are higher outside the cell.
- K+ naturally moves out of the cell due to the **concentration gradient** but is balanced by electrical forces.

#### **3. Nernst Equation (Electrostatic Potential)**

- Used to calculate the equilibrium potential for each ion.
- Key constants:
    - **R** = Gas constant (8.314 J/(K·mol))
    - **T** = Temperature in Kelvin (298.15 K at 25°C)
    - **Z** = Ion charge
    - **F** = Faraday constant (C/mol)

#### **4. Membrane as an Electrical Circuit**

- **Each ion has a conductance (gx) and an electrical potential (Ex).**
- The **membrane acts as a capacitor** and ion channels act as resistors.
- No net current when: **Ik + ICl + INa = 0**.

#### **5. Action Potential & Hodgkin-Huxley Model**

- Action potentials are due to changes in **Na+ and K+ channel activity**.
- Hodgkin & Huxley discovered:
    - **K+ outward current increases as voltage rises**.
    - **Na+ inward current increases until +55 mV, then stops**.
- They modeled ion flow using two key factors:
    1. **Ion channel conductance (gNa, gK)** - Number of open channels.
    2. **Electrochemical driving force** - How much ions want to move.
- Used **Kirchhoff’s Law** to create equations but needed 20 parameters to solve.

#### **6. Alternative Models**

- **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model** simplifies calculations by ignoring voltage details.
