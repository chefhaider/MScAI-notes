This chapter introduces three main classes of music representations: **sheet music**, **symbolic**, and **audio**. It emphasizes that each representation captures different aspects of a musical object, and no single representation is comprehensive. The chapter aims to build intuition about musical concepts and introduce basic terminology.

### Sheet Music Representation

- **Definition:** Visual representation of a musical score, either printed or in digital image format.
- **Key elements:** The chapter introduces basic elements of Western music notation, such as **pitch**, **duration**, and **onset time**.
    - **Staff**: The five horizontal lines on which musical notes are placed.
    - **Clef**: A symbol placed at the beginning of the staff to indicate the pitch of the notes.
    - **Notes**: Symbols representing musical tones with specific pitches and durations.
- **Limitations:** Sheet music does not fully capture all aspects of music, such as artistic interpretation or variations in performance. Different versions of a piece may exist in sheet music.
- **Running example:** Beethovenâ€™s Symphony No. 5 is used as a consistent example.

### Symbolic Representation

- **Definition:** Score representations that explicitly encode musical events like notes.
- **Examples:** MIDI is a standard for controlling music synthesizers.
- **Piano-roll representation:** Visually describes the most important attributes of musical notes in an easy-to-understand way, and can be derived from other encodings including MIDI and audio. Can be seen as a mid-level representation to establish semantic relations across various forms of music.
- **Optical Music Recognition (OMR):** The process of transforming sheet music into symbolic representations.
- **Focus:** While details of formats like MIDI are mentioned, a deep understanding isn't required for most parts of the book, but becomes important when working with data in practice.

### Audio Representation

- **Definition:** Representations of acoustic sound waves.
- **Key Concepts**
    - **Waveform:** A graphical representation of a sound wave, showing changes in amplitude over time.
    - **Frequency**: The rate at which a sound wave repeats, measured in Hertz (Hz).
    - **Pitch**: The perceived highness or lowness of a sound.
    - **Timbre**: The unique quality of a sound that distinguishes it from others.
    - **Spectrogram**: A visual representation of the frequencies present in a sound over time, which can be used to understand the characteristics of sound waves.
- **Focus:** Properties of sound waves including frequency, dynamics, and timbre are discussed.

### Key Terminologies

- **Chroma:** A term that refers to the 12 pitch classes and the quality of a sound that is perceived as similar. Notes with different chroma values have a different "sound color".
- **Octave:** An interval between two notes where one has twice the frequency of the other.
- **Pitch class:** All notes that have the same chroma value, perceived as similar in a certain way.
- **Musical Attributes:** Notes, pitch, chroma, note length, dynamics, or time signature.

### Overlap and Boundaries

- The boundaries between these three classes of representations are not always clear. Symbolic representations can be used for both rendering sheet music and synthesizing audio.
- **Music Transcription:** The process of extracting note events and score parameters from a music recording.

### Other Considerations

- Human perception is crucial when describing musical attributes such as pitch, loudness, and timbre.
- Music is considered abstract, and these representations are aspects of music but not music itself.
